# PokerHandStrength
Poker hand strength calculation

A set of classes that take in an argument of "Card" objects, then simulates a given number of poker games, and returns a win percentage based on those simulations.

A few notes:
-Object oriented approach. Instead of relying on poker hash tables, I was mainly interested in actually simulating the games and seeing if the results lined up with known values, and also doing it in a readable way.
-Since I simulated everything, I included basic threads to speed up the process.

To see usage, look at main.cpp file.
